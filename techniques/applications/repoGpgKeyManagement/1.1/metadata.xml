<TECHNIQUE name="Package repository keys (RPM/APT)">

  <DESCRIPTION>
   Manages trusted GPG Keys for the RPM / zypper / APT Package Managers.
   
It uses `rpm --import` and `apt-key add` to load, and `rpm -e` and `apt-key remove` to remove keys.

You can use multiple instances of Directives based on this Technique, but keep in mind:
when conflicting actions are specified on the same hash by different directives, it will flip-flop!
